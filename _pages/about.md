I am a Professor in the Department of Statistics and an Affiliated Member of A.I. Research Institute at Seoul National University. I currently serve on the editorial boards of the Journal of the Korean Statistical Society, JASA/TAS Review, and Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems. 

I received my BS in Computer Science and Statistics and MS in Statistics from Seoul National University in 1991 and 1993, respectively. After a brief stint at Texas A&M University, I went to Carnegie Mellon University to become a Bayesian. Ironically, I didn't do any Bayesian stuff for my Ph.D. thesis but landed at Duke in the Bayesian world. After spending eight years at Duke and the University of Georgia, I joined the Department of Statistics at Seoul National University in 2012. 

To me, statistics is a tool for solving scientific problems. I feel lucky to choose statistics as my professional area so I can still pursue all my childhood dreams - whether it be an astronomer, geneticist, or a baseball analyst. On the theoretical side, I am interested in developing a framework for infinite-dimensional data common in many scientific areas. On the application side, my collaborations encompass astronomy, biology, digital humanity, epidemiology, neuroscience, and politics.
